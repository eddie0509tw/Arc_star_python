# Arc*: Asynchronous Event-based Corner Detection 
This code is a reimplementation of the Arc* algorithm described in the paper  "**Asynchronous Corner Detection and Tracking for Event Cameras in Real Time**", Alzugaray & Chli, RA-L 2018. This work was developed at the [Vision for Robotics Lab](http://v4rl.ethz.ch/), [ETH Zurich](http://ethz.ch/).


# Reference:
The code of detector is mainly reference and reimplement from this [github](https://github.com/ialzugaray/arc_star_ros), but in a python fashion. The implementation includes Arc detector and Arc tracker and it does not require the usage of ROS. The plot is from matplotlib package directly drawing events on the image frames.
