# Arc*: Asynchronous Event-based Corner Detection 
This code is a reimplementation of the Arc* algorithm described in the paper  "**Asynchronous Corner Detection and Tracking for Event Cameras in Real Time**", Alzugaray & Chli, RA-L 2018. This work was developed at the [Vision for Robotics Lab](http://v4rl.ethz.ch/), [ETH Zurich](http://ethz.ch/).


# Reference:
The code is mainly reference and reimplement from this [github](https://github.com/ialzugaray/arc_star_ros), but in a python fashion
